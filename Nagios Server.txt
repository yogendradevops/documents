Nagios


Nagios is an awesome Open Source monitoring tool, it provides you more comprehensive monitoring environment to always keep an eye on your all machines/networks whether you are in your data center or just your small labs.
With Nagios, you can monitor your remote hosts and their services remotely on a single window. It shows warnings and indicates if something goes wrong in your servers which eventually helps us to detect some problems before they occur. It helps us to reduce downtime and business losses.
Recently, Nagios released its latest versions Nagios Core 4.4.5 and its latest stable release of Nagios plugins 2.2.1 on August 20, 2019.




Installing Nagios 4.4.5 and Nagios Plugin 2.2.1
If you follow these instructions correctly, you will end up with the following information.
1. Nagios and its plugins will be installed under /usr/local/nagios directory.
2. Nagios will be configured to monitor few services of your local machine (Disk Usage, CPU Load, Current Users, Total Processes, etc.)
3. Nagios web interface will be available at http://localhost/nagios
Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
We need to install Apache, PHP and some libraries like gcc, glibc, glibc-common and GD libraries and its development libraries before installing Nagios 4.4.5 with the source. And to do so, we can use yum default package installer.
Step 2: Create Nagios User and Group
Create a new nagios user using useradd command and nagcmd group account and set a password.
Next, add both the nagios user and the apache user to the nagcmd group using usermod command.
Step 3: Download Nagios Core 4.4.5 and Nagios Plugin 2.2.1


Create a directory for your Nagios installation and all its future downloads.


Now download latest Nagios Core 4.4.5 and Nagios plugins 2.2.1 packages with wget command.


Step 4: Extract Nagios Core and its Plugins
We need to extract downloaded packages with tar command as follows.
[localhost.localdomain nagios~]# tar -xvf nagios-4.4.5.tar.gz
[localhost.localdomain nagios~]# tar -xvf nagios-plugins-2.2.1.tar.gz
When you extract these tarballs with tar command, two new folders will appear in that directory.
ls -l
 




Configure Nagios Core
Now, first we will configure Nagios Core and to do so we need to go to Nagios directory and run configure file and if everything goes fine, it will show the output in the end as sample output. Please see below.
[localhost.localdomain nagios~]# cd nagios-4.4.5/
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5 ]# ./configure --with-command-group=nagcmd








After configuring, we need to compile and install all the binaries with make all and make install command, it will install all the needed libraries in your machine and we can proceed further.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5 ]# make all
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5 ]# make install




The following command will install the init scripts for Nagios.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5 ]# make install-init




To make Nagios work from command line we need to install command-mode.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5 ]# make install-commandmode
Next, install sample Nagios files, please run following command.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5 ]# make install-config






Step 5: Customising Nagios Configuration
Open the “contacts.cfg” file with your choice of editor and set the email address associated with the nagiosadmin contact definition to receiving email alerts.
# vi /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/contacts.cfg




Step 6: Install and Configure Web Interface for Nagios


We are done with all configuration in the backend, now we will configure Web Interface For Nagios with the following command. The below command will Configure Web interface for Nagios and a web admin user will be created “nagiosadmin”.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5 ]# make install-webconf
In this step, we will be creating a password for “nagiosadmin”. After executing this command, please provide a password twice and keep it remembered because this password will be used when you login in the Nagios Web interface.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5]# htpasswd -s -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user nagiosadmin
Restart Apache to make the new settings take effect.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5]# service httpd start               [On RHEL/CentOS 6]
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5]# systemctl start httpd.service     [On RHEL/CentOS 7/8 and Fedora]


Step 7: Compile and Install Nagios Plugin
We have downloaded Nagios plugins in /root/nagios, Go there and configure and install it as directed below.
[localhost.localdomain nagios-4.4.5]# cd /root/nagios
[localhost.localdomain nagios]# cd nagios-plugins-2.2.1/
[localhost.localdomain nagios-plugins-2.2.1]# ./configure --with-nagios-user=nagios --with-nagios-group=nagios
[localhost.localdomain nagios-plugins-2.2.1]# make
[localhost.localdomain nagios-plugins-2.2.1]# make install
Step 8: Verify Nagios Configuration Files
Now we are all done with Nagios configuration and its time to verify it and to do so please insert the following command. If everything goes smooth it will show up similar to the output below.
[localhost.localdomain nagios]# /usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg






Step 9: Add Nagios Services to System Startup
To make Nagios work across reboots, we need to add nagios and httpd with chkconfig and systemctl command.
On RHEL/CentOS 6
[ localhost.localdomain ]# chkconfig --add nagios
[localhost.localdomain  ]# chkconfig --level 35 nagios on
[localhost.localdomain  ]# chkconfig --add httpd
[localhost.localdomain  ]# chkconfig --level 35 httpd on




On RHEL/CentOS 7/8 and Fedora
[localhost.localdomain  ]# systemctl enable nagios
[localhost.localdomain  ]# systemctl enable httpd


Restart Nagios to make the new settings take effect.
[localhost.localdomain  ]# service nagios start              [On RHEL/CentOS 6]
[localhost.localdomain  ]# systemctl start nagios.service    [On RHEL/CentOS 7/8 and Fedora]


Step 10: Login to the Nagios Web Interface
Your Nagios is ready to work, please open it in your browser with “http://Your-server-IP-address/nagios” or “http://FQDN/nagios” and Provide the username “nagiosadmin” and password.
Upgrade Nagios 3.x to Nagios 4.4.5
If you are already running an older version of Nagios, you can upgrade it anytime. To do so, you just need to download the latest tar archive of it and configure it as shown below.
[localhost.localdomain]# service nagios stop
[localhost.localdomain ]# wget https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/releases/nagios-4.4.5.tar.gz
[localhost.localdomain ]# tar -zxvf nagios-4.4.5.tar.gz
[localhost.localdomain ]# cd nagios-4.4.5
[localhost.localdomain ]# ./configure
[localhost.localdomain ]# make all
[localhost.localdomain ]# make install
[localhost.localdomain ]# service nagios start
That’s it for now, in my upcoming articles, I will show you how to add Linux, Windows, Printers, Switches, and Devices to Nagios monitoring Server. If you’re having any trouble while installing, please do contact us via comments.
