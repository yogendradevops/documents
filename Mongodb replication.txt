Mongodb replication




To configure replication in MongoDB, you need to perform the following steps:
1. Start the MongoDB instances that will act as the replica set members. Each instance should be started with a unique --replSet option value.
For example, if you have three MongoDB instances running on the same machine, you can start them with the following commands:
mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath /data/rs0-0 --port 27017
mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath /data/rs0-1 --port 27018
mongod --replSet rs0 --dbpath /data/rs0-2 --port 27019


2. Connect to one of the MongoDB instances and initiate the replica set configuration using the rs.initiate() method.
mongo --port 27017
> rs.initiate()


3. Add the remaining replica set members using the rs.add() method.
> rs.add("localhost:27018")
> rs.add("localhost:27019")


4. Verify the replication status using the rs.status() method.
> rs.status()


This will display information about the replica set configuration and its status, such as the number of members, their states, and the replication lag.
Once replication is configured, MongoDB will automatically replicate data between the replica set members, providing fault tolerance and high availability.

To configure replication in MongoDB servers located in different locations, you can follow the steps below:
1. Set up a MongoDB server in each location where you want to replicate data.
2. Configure the firewall settings on each server to allow incoming and outgoing traffic on the default MongoDB port (27017) or any other custom port you choose to use.
3. Create a MongoDB user with the appropriate privileges for replication. You can use the following command to create a user:
db.createUser({
  user: "<replication_username>",
  pwd: "<replication_password>",
  roles: ["replication"]
})


Enable replication on the primary server by adding the following lines to the MongoDB configuration file (mongod.conf):


replication:
  replSetName: "<replica_set_name>"


1. Replace <replica_set_name> with a name of your choice.
2. Start the MongoDB service on the primary server.
3. Connect to the primary server and initiate the replica set using the following command:
rs.initiate()


Add the secondary servers to the replica set using the following command:
rs.add("<secondary_server_ip>:<port>")


1. Replace <secondary_server_ip> with the IP address of the secondary server and <port> with the MongoDB port number.
2. Repeat step 7 for all additional secondary servers.
3. Verify that replication is working by checking the replica set status using the following command:
rs.status()


1. This will display the current status of the replica set and the replication lag between the primary and secondary servers.
Note: If the MongoDB servers are located in different data centers or cloud regions, you may experience latency and network issues that can affect replication performance. In this case, you may want to consider using a replication technology like MongoDB Atlas, which provides cross-region replication with automatic failover and high availability.
