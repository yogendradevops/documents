Q2. How to verify/test/evaluate google search algorithm is working as per google documentation?


Google Search works in three stages, and not all pages make it through each stage:
1. Crawling: Google downloads text, images, and videos from pages it found on the internet with automated programs called crawlers.
2. Indexing: Google analyses the text, images, and video files on the page, and stores the information in the Google index, which is a large database.
3. Serving search results: When a user searches on Google, Google returns information that's relevant to the user's query.
