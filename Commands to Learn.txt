Options:
-c     
    Same as -m option, used for POSIX compatibility.


-u, --user
    Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.


-k, --kill
    Kill  processes accessing the file. Unless changed with -SIGNAL, SIGKILL is sent. An fuser process
    never kills itself, but may kill other fuser processes. The  effective  user  ID  of  the  process
    executing fuser is set to its real user ID before attempting to kill.kill.


-m NAME, --mount NAME
    NAME specifies a file on a mounted file system or a block device that is  mounted.  All  processes
    accessing  files  on  that  file  system  are  listed.   If  a  directory file is specified, it is
    automatically changed to NAME/. to use any file system that might be mounted on
