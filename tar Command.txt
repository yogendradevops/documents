18 Tar Command Examples in Linux
The Linux “tar” stands for tape archive, which is used by a large number of Linux/Unix system administrators to deal with tape drives backup.
The tar command is used to rip a collection of files and directories into a highly compressed archive file commonly called tarball or tar, gzip and bzip in Linux.
The tar is the most widely used command to create compressed archive files and that can be moved easily from one disk to another disk or machine to machine.


In this article, we will be going to review and discuss various tar command examples including how to create archive files using (tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz2) compression, how to extract archive file, extract a single file, view content of the file, verify a file, add files or directories to the existing archive file, estimate the size of tar archive file, etc.


1. Create tar Archive File in Linux
The below example command will create a tar archive file tecmint-14-09-12.tar for a directory /home/tecmint in the current working directory. 


# tar -cvf tecmint-14-09-12.tar /home/tecmint/


Let’s discuss each option used in the above command to create a tar archive file.
1. c – Creates a new .tar archive file.
2. v – Verbosely show the .tar file progress.
3. f – File name type of the archive file.
4. 2. Create tar.gz Archive File in Linux
To create a compressed gzip archive file we use the option as z. For example, the below command will create a compressed MyImages-14-09-12.tar.gz file for the directory /home/MyImages. (Note: tar.gz and tgz both are similar).


# tar cvzf MyImages-14-09-12.tar.gz /home/MyImages
OR
# tar cvzf MyImages-14-09-12.tgz /home/MyImages


3. Create tar.bz2 Archive File in Linux
The bz2 feature compresses and creates an archive file less than the size of the gzip. The bz2 compression takes more time to compress and decompress files than gzip, which takes less time.


To create a highly compressed tar file we use the option j. The following example command will create a Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 file for a directory /home/php. (Note: tar.bz2 and tbz is similar to tb2).


# tar cvfj Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 /home/php
OR
# tar cvfj Phpfiles-org.tar.tbz /home/php
OR 
# tar cvfj Phpfiles-org.tar.tb2 /home/php




4. Untar tar Archive File in Linux
To untar or extract a tar file, just issue the following command using option x (extract). For example, the below command will untar the file public_html-14-09-12.tar in the present working directory.
If you want to untar in a different directory then use option as -C (specified directory).
## Untar files in Current Directory ##
# tar -xvf public_html-14-09-12.tar


## Untar files in specified Directory ##
# tar -xvf public_html-14-09-12.tar -C /home/public_html/videos/


5. Uncompress tar.gz Archive File in Linux
To Uncompress tar.gz archive file, just run the following command. If we would like to untar in different directories, just use option -C and the directory path, as shown in the above example.


# tar -xvf thumbnails-14-09-12.tar.gz


6. Uncompress tar.bz2 Archive File in Linux
To Uncompress the highly compressed tar.bz2 file, just use the following command. The below example command will untar all the .flv files from the archive file.


# tar -xvf videos-14-09-12.tar.bz2




7. List Content of tar Archive File in Linux
To list the contents of the tar archive file, just run the following command with option t (list content). The below command will list the content of the uploadprogress.tar file.


# tar -tvf uploadprogress.tar


8. List Content tar.gz Archive File in Linux
Use the following command to list the content of the tar.gz file.


# tar -tvf staging.tecmint.com.tar.gz




9. List Content tar.bz2 Archive File in Linux
To list the content of the tar.bz2 file, issue the following command.


# tar -tvf Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2


10. Untar Single file from tar File in Linux
To extract a single file called cleanfiles.sh from cleanfiles.sh.tar use the following command.


# tar -xvf cleanfiles.sh.tar cleanfiles.sh
OR
# tar --extract --file=cleanfiles.sh.tar cleanfiles.sh




11. Untar Single file from tar.gz File in Linux
To extract a single file tecmintbackup.xml from the tecmintbackup.tar.gz archive file, use the command as follows.


# tar -zxvf tecmintbackup.tar.gz tecmintbackup.xml
OR
# tar --extract --file=tecmintbackup.tar.gz tecmintbackup.xml




12. Untar Single file from tar.bz2 File in Linux
To extract a single file called index.php from the file Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 use the following option.


# tar -jxvf Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 home/php/index.php
OR
# tar --extract --file=Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 /home/php/index.php


13. Untar Multiple files from tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz2 File


To extract or untar multiple files from the tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz2 archive file. For example, the below command will extract “file 1” “file 2” from the archive files.


# tar -xvf tecmint-14-09-12.tar "file1" "file2" 


# tar -zxvf MyImages-14-09-12.tar.gz "file1" "file2" 


# tar -jxvf Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 "file1" "file2"




14. Extract Group of Files using Wildcard in Linux


To extract a group of files we use wildcard-based extracting. For example, to extract a group of all files whose pattern begins with .php from a tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz2 archive file.


# tar -xvf Phpfiles-org.tar --wildcards '*.php'


# tar -zxvf Phpfiles-org.tar.gz --wildcards '*.php'


# tar -jxvf Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 --wildcards '*.php'




15. Add Files or Directories to tar Archive File in Linux


To add files or directories to the existing tar archive files we use the option r (append). For example, we add file xyz.txt and directory php to the existing tecmint-14-09-12.tar archive file.


# tar -rvf tecmint-14-09-12.tar xyz.txt


# tar -rvf tecmint-14-09-12.tar php
























16. Add Files or Directories to tar.gz and tar.bz2 Files


The tar command doesn’t have an option to add files or directories to an existing compressed tar.gz and tar.bz2 archive file. If we do try will get the following error.


# tar -rvf MyImages-14-09-12.tar.gz xyz.txt


# tar -rvf Phpfiles-org.tar.bz2 xyz.txt


tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Skipping to next header
xyz.txt
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors




17. How To Verify tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz2 Archive File
To verify any tar or compressed archived file we use the option W (verify). To do this, just use the following examples of commands. (Note: You cannot do verification on a compressed ( *.tar.gz, *.tar.bz2 ) archive file).


# tar tvfW tecmint-14-09-12.tar


18. Check the Size of the tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz2 Archive File
To check the size of any tar, tar.gz, and tar.bz2 archive file, use the following command. For example, the below command will display the size of the archive file in Kilobytes (KB).


# tar -czf - tecmint-14-09-12.tar | wc -c
