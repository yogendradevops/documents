How to ask question the smart way:
Before You Ask
Before asking a technical question by email, or on a website chat board, do the following:
1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.
2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web.
3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.
4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.
5. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.


* When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first and also display what you have learned from doing these things.
When You Ask
Choose your forum carefully
Be sensitive in choosing where you ask your question. You are likely to be ignored, or written off as a loser, if you:
* post your question to a forum where it's off topic.
* post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa
The first step, therefore, is to find the right forum. Again, Google and other Web-searching methods are your friend.


When selecting a Web forum, newsgroup or mailing list, don't trust the name by itself too far; look for a FAQ or charter to verify your question is on-topic.


Use meaningful, specific subject headers
On mailing lists or Web forums, the subject header is your golden opportunity to attract qualified experts.
Don't waste it on babble like “Please help me” 


If you ask a question in a reply, be sure to change the subject line to indicate that you're asking a question. A Subject line that looks like “Re: test” or “Re: new bug” is less likely to attract useful amounts of attention.


Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language
Spend the extra effort to polish your language.Spell, punctuate, and capitalise correctly. Don't TYPE IN ALL CAPS; this is read as shouting and considered rude. 


Be precise and informative about your problem




Be precise and informative about your problem
* Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.
* Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “CentOS 7”, “Ubuntu”, etc.).
* Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.
* Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.
* Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration. 


Don't flag your question as “Urgent”, even if it is for you
















* Be precise and give informative information related to your problem so that others can understand your problem and give suggestions or solutions in proper way.


* Share all the details related to the problem and the steps taken. 


* The best way to improve your chances of getting an answer is by making it easier for us to answer you.
