Booting Process Assignment:


1 Create a Dual boot system with 2 linux distributions. - Ubuntu & Fedora
I installed Fedora first on my PC after that I installed Ubuntu for dual boot on another partition.


2 Configure GRUB for waiting 15 seconds before booting the operating system by default if no key is pressed.
Open the GRUB config file using the terminal
sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
##Change GRUB_TIMEOUT=15  for for splash screen waiting 15 seconds
GRUB_TIMEOUT=15


3 Change the default Operating system
Open the GRUB config file using the terminal
sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
I changed GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=saved

6 How does BIOS work in virtual machines?
A VM BIOS (virtual machine basic input/output system) is the set of instructions that controls the booting process of a virtual machine.
Each hypervisor has a different process for accessing and editing VM BIOS. In Microsoft Hyper-V, administrators can access VM BIOS settings with the Hyper-V Manager. VMware VM BIOS settings can be adjusted through vSphere. Different VM versions or formats also have different VM BIOS settings. For example, in addition to adjusting boot order, BIOS settings for a Hyper-V Generation 2 VM offer a secure boot option, which is a feature that prevents unauthorised code from running on boot up.
